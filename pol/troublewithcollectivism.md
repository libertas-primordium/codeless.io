# The Trouble With Collectivism
The root problem with all collectivist ideologies is that they are predicated on the unstated assumption that everyone holds the same values and aspirations. That assumption is a total fallacy. Not even Maslow's hierarchy of needs is universal, as humans possess the mental capacity to supercede this hierarchy at will. Entrepreneurs and military veterans both understand this concept well. One can be cold, hungry, and in personal danger, and still remain laser-focused on an external goal.

A truly equitable society must make allowances for these differences in values and aspirations. If free-thinking people truly respect human life, they must reject outright any ideologies which seek to paint all persons in the same brush strokes.
