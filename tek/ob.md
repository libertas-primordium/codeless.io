# A Modest Proposal
### *The Power Of The Network*
OpenBazaar started with a great idea. The world needs a decentralized marketplace. The network seems to be lacking in energy/activity however. I think the thing that is missing is a social media aspect. There is a reason why Facebook marketplace has practically made craigslist obsolete. OpenBazaar's decentralized market, combined with social media and monetized IPFS based storage and content delivery, would present a network with enough utility to compete with maintstream internet giants.
