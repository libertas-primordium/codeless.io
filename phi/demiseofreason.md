# The Demise of Reason
"Don't question the science" is quite possibly the most unscientific statement that one could make.  Such a statement is, in fact, the hallmark of *religion*, not science.  Science demands rigorous questioning. Science accounts for the possibility of being wrong.  Science accepts not having all the pieces of the puzzle.  Science affords room for the unkown.

It is religion which demands unwaivering faith in its dicates.
